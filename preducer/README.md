# Preducer
A precision reducer for Fortran77 files, from `double precision` to `real`.

## Why?
We needed a way to downgrade the precision in F77 files, to observe the
differences in roundoff. Note that using preducer does not necessarily improve
performance, as the created code contains various cast operations. Preducer
is only really useful for studying roundoff effects, before modifying the
precision by other means if the reduced precision is still sufficient.
You wouldn't have used Preducer in a production code anyways, would you?

## How?
Preducer is a Python script that parses F77 files, finds all subroutines and
functions contained therein, and changes all their variables from double to
single precision. The new routines/functions will have the original name with
\_sp appended.  For example, `subroutine foo` becomes `subroutine foo_sp`.

To make it easier to call these new routines, a wrapper will be created that
has the original name (in this case `foo`) and all arguments still have the
original precision. This wrapper will cast all inputs to single precision, then
call the low precision routine (`foo_sp`) using single precision inputs, and
finally casts the results to double precision before returning. This way, the
files created by Preducer can be used as drop-in replacements in existing
software.

## Installation
Preducer imports the following packages, (pip) install them as necessary:
```
fparser, sys, re, textwrap
```

## Usage
The script can be directly called from the command line as
```
./preducer FILENAME.f
./preducer FILENAME.f SUBROUTINENAME
./preducer -verbose FILENAME.f
./preducer -verbose FILENAME.f SUBROUTINENAME
```

## CUTEST
We used preducer as part of a Julia wrapper for CUTEst optimization problems.
The Julia wrapper uses SIFDECODER to create a F77 file, after which we call
Preducer to modify the precision. Preducer is tested on the files that
SIFDECODER creates, and may break in various ways on other input files.
The Julia code was modified to call Preducer and pass verbosity flags
appropriately, the result is also included in this repository.

## CUTEST installation
If you plan to use Preducer with the Julia CUTEST package, it is
additionally necessary to define an environment variable called "PREDUCER"
holding the Preducer directory. In the `CUTEST.jl` file, the follwing lines
must be added directly below `if isfile("ELFUN.f")`:
```
      if "-preduce" in args
        preducenv = ENV["PREDUCER"]
        preducer = "$preducenv/preducer.py"
        if verbose
          preducer = ["$preducenv/preducer.py","-verbose"]
        end
        run(`$preducer ELFUN.f`)
        run(`mv ELFUN_preduced.f ELFUN.f`)
        run(`$preducer EXTER.f`)
        run(`mv EXTER_preduced.f EXTER.f`)
        run(`$preducer GROUP.f`)
        run(`mv GROUP_preduced.f GROUP.f`)
        run(`$preducer RANGE.f`)
        run(`mv RANGE_preduced.f RANGE.f`)
      end
```

## CUTEST usage
Use Preducer from Julia's CUTEST as follows:
```
nlp = CUTEstModel("ROSENBR", "-preduce")
nlp = CUTEstModel("ROSENBR", verbose=true, "-preduce")
```
